This is a PHP-based Library Gate Management System designed to track the entry and exit of students and staff in a library. The system records in-time and out-time for users and generates reports based on the date range. It also supports generating department-wise counts of students and staff, with the ability to export the report to a CSV file.

## Features

- Track user entry and exit times using barcode scanning for student ID cards.
- Record and display the in-time and out-time for both students and staff.
- Generate a report for a specific date range showing the department-wise count of students and staff.
- Display counts for each department, including 0 for departments without any entries on the selected date range.
- Export generated reports to a CSV file for offline use.
- Clean and responsive user interface for easy report generation and management.
